# The Other

This week we will be working on a new contemporary dance called [The Other](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9JIJGy96vV3RW1wVEZGbDc0UndPZFpGYXlHUllPSU1FR3lV/view).

The David brief needs some project management before we can start working on it. If anyone is interested in project management, please speak to Ali.

This week we will be learning to program Arduinos, as well as getting to grips with tools like [GitHub](https://github.com) and [Trello](https://trello.com/).

You will also be continuing your work on your personal websites, making use of libraries like Bootstrap.

Next week we will start working properly on David.

### Session 1 & 2

### Introduction to Programming

We will discuss computational thinking and then look at Blockly together.

Having got into the discipline of writing syntax in HTML and CSS, it's time to look at programming. We will start with some thought exercises and then use a visual programming environment, Google Blockly, to express computational ideas without syntax holding us back.

#### Session notes:

* Functions: Actions
* Variables: Data
  * true/false (boolean)
  * objects
  * numbers (with units, decimal places)
* Logic: Decisions
  * While loops
  * If statements

##### F.R.E.D

While cup isn't present:

* Spin 60deg in 1 second
* Find Cup
* If Cup is visible, break loop

Walk Forward

If distanceToCup less than or equals 5cm

*stop

Very exact: don't assume anything
Working with loops â€“ they stop when some condition becomes true

#### Sessions 3 & 4

Programming Arduinos in teams.

We will work on a brief that will kickstart our work on The Other, as well as repeating some of the concepts we learnt in Google Blockly.

We wired up our Arduinos using the Arduino Fade sketch.

Pull request please!!
