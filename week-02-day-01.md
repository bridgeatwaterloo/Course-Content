# The Other

This week we will be working on a new contemporary dance called [The Other](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9JIJGy96vV3RW1wVEZGbDc0UndPZFpGYXlHUllPSU1FR3lV/view).

The David brief needs some project management before we can start working on it. If anyone is interested in project management, please speak to Ali.

This week we will be learning to program Arduinos, as well as getting to grips with tools like [GitHub](https://github.com) and [Trello](https://trello.com/).

You will also be continuing your work on your personal websites, making use of libraries like Bootstrap.

Next week we will start working properly on David.
